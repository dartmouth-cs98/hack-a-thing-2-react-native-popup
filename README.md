### What I Built - React Native and Pop-Up

For the 2nd Hack-a-thing, everyone in our group wanted to get more comfortable working with React Native if that was potentially something we were going to build an application. We intended to all follow the same tutorial http://cs52.me/assignments/sa/react-native/ from cs52 and then work on one unique component per pair that we might want to try for the project. We chose to work on create some kind of pop-up menu similar to the way we want to present questions to the users. We both had trouble with various popup m/c libraries so we just worked through a few tutorials to make sample apps.

### What I Learned

It was good to get a jump into React Native, amazing how much of the tutorial has become obsolete (`ListView` is deprecated), or components have been moved into different libraries. I'm also seeing how carefully we are going to have to think about the new UI libraries and components we introduce into the app, maybe only using ones above a certain number of stars on Github. The dependencies quickly balloon up and whenever my app experienced strange behavior or wouldn't build, it was because of an import statement for one of the libraries. We may save time building our own components.

### What Didn't Work

I think we had the right idea about our approach to this hack a thing, but we ran into many roadblocks, such as neither of us being able to use the [paraboly pop-up library](https://reactnativeexample.com/customizable-report-modal-via-paraboly-for-react-native/) or the [multiple choice picker](https://github.com/nguythaitinh/react-native-multiple-choice-picker) even though the components and UI for both seemed so simple. I'm also planning to try to rewrite the ListView as a FlatView for the original tutorial from CS52.
